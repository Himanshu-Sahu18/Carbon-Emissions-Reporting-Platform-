## üí° Understanding the Data

### Scope 1 (Direct Emissions)

- **What**: Emissions you directly control
- **Examples**: Diesel, Natural Gas, Gasoline
- **Typical %**: 60-80% of total emissions
- **Why it matters**: These are the easiest to reduce through operational changes

### Scope 2 (Indirect - Electricity)

- **What**: Emissions from purchased electricity
- **Examples**: Grid Electricity
- **Typical %**: 15-30% of total emissions
- **Why it matters**: Can be reduced through renewable energy or efficiency

### Scope 3 (Other Indirect)

- **What**: Emissions from your value chain
- **Examples**: Business Travel, Commute, Waste
- **Typical %**: 5-20% of total emissions
- **Why it matters**: Often overlooked but important for complete footprint

## üîç How to Check Valid Activities

Run this command to see all available activities in your database:

```bash
docker exec ghg_postgres_db psql -U ghg_user -d ghg_platform -c "SELECT activity_name, activity_unit, scope, co2e_per_unit FROM emission_factors WHERE valid_to IS NULL ORDER BY activity_name;"
```

This shows you exactly what activity names and units are valid!

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Case Sensitive**: Activity names must match EXACTLY (including capitals)
2. **Copy-Paste**: To avoid typos, copy activity names from this guide
3. **Units Matter**: Each activity has a specific unit - don't mix them up
4. **Dates**: Use format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-10-15)
5. **Location/Department**: These are optional but helpful for reporting
6. **Start Small**: Test with one entry first before bulk data entry

---

## üÜò Still Getting Errors?

### Check These:

1. ‚úÖ Activity name spelled exactly right (case-sensitive)
2. ‚úÖ Unit matches the activity (see table above)
3. ‚úÖ Date is not in the future
4. ‚úÖ Value is positive (greater than 0)
5. ‚úÖ Date format is YYYY-MM-DD

### Common Mistakes:

- Using "electricity" instead of "Grid Electricity"
- Using "meters" instead of "cubic meters"
- Using lowercase "diesel" instead of "Diesel"
- Forgetting the space in "Business Travel - Air"

## üìû Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the browser console (F12) for detailed error messages
2. Verify the backend is running: `docker-compose ps`
3. Check backend logs: `docker-compose logs backend`
4. Review the API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

---

**Key Rule**: Activity Name + Unit must EXACTLY match what's in the database. Copy-paste from the examples above to avoid typos! üéØ
