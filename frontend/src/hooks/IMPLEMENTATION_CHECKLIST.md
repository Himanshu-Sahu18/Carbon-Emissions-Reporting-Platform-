- [x] Type definitions documented
- [x] Usage patterns documented
- [x] Common patterns documented
- [x] Requirements mapping documented

## ✅ Integration

- [x] Hooks exported from index.ts
- [x] Types imported from types directory

## Verification Commands Run

```bash
# TypeScript compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit
# Result: ✅ No errors

# Diagnostics check
getDiagnostics on all hook files
# Result: ✅ No diagnostics found
```

## Next Steps

These hooks are now ready to be consumed by:

- Task 6: Common UI components (LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage, etc.)
- Task 7: Emission Form component
- Task 8: Business Metrics Form component
- Task 9: Year-over-Year Chart component
- Task 10: Emission Hotspot Donut Chart component
- Task 11: Emission Intensity KPI Card component
- Task 12: Monthly Trend Line Chart component
- Task 13: Dashboard Layout component

## Task Status

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

All sub-tasks have been implemented and verified. The hooks are fully functional, type-safe, and ready for integration with UI components.
