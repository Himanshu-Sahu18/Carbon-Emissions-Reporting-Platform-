# Carbon Emissions Platform - Advanced Analytics & Reporting Engine

A comprehensive API for tracking, analyzing, and reporting carbon emissions with **historical accuracy** at its core.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Historical Accuracy Foundation
All emission calculations use the emission factors that were valid on the activity date, ensuring:
- **Immutable historical data** - Past calculations never change when factors are updated
- **Audit trail** - Complete traceability of which factor version was used
- **Temporal queries** - Factor selection based on validity periods (valid_from/valid_to)

### ðŸ“Š Analytics Capabilities

1. **Year-over-Year (YoY) Emissions Comparison**
   - Compare emissions between years by scope (1, 2, 3)
   - Track progress toward reduction goals
   - Calculate percentage and absolute changes

2. **Emission Intensity Calculation**
   - Calculate carbon efficiency (kgCOâ‚‚e per unit of production)
   - Normalize emissions against business metrics
   - Measure operational efficiency improvements

3. **Emission Hotspot Analysis**
   - Identify highest-contributing emission sources
   - Prioritize reduction efforts
   - Analyze by activity type, scope, and time period

## Historical Accuracy Mechanism

When an emission record is created:
1. System queries for the emission factor valid on the activity date
2. Factor is selected using: `valid_from <= activity_date AND (valid_to >= activity_date OR valid_to IS NULL)`
3. The `factor_id` is permanently linked to the emission record
4. Even if factors are updated later, historical records remain unchanged

This "pyramid strategy" ensures all analytical insights are built on a foundation of trustworthy, auditable data.

## API Standards

- **RESTful design** - Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **JSON responses** - All responses in JSON format
- **Error handling** - Standardized error responses with codes and details
- **Validation** - Comprehensive input validation using Pydantic
- **Performance** - Optimized SQL queries with proper indexing

## Authentication

Currently, the API is open for development. Production deployments should implement:
- API key authentication
- Rate limiting
- Role-based access control
